## Motivation

As a maintainer, I use the [`goreleaser`][goreleaser] to build and publish binaries
of my tools and services. But the `godownloader` is no longer actively maintained and
doesn't support new `goreleaser` configurations. I need to adapt it to new versions
of `goreleaser` and generate actual installation shell scripts.

As a developer, I want to install the `godownloader` using [`Homebrew`][brew] or
a shell script generated by it. But the `godownloader` doesn't support that.
I need to add support for new `goreleaser` versions and `Homebrew`.

[goreleaser]:   https://goreleaser.com
[brew]:         https://brew.sh

## What's changed

- The `godownloader` supports new versions of `goreleaser`.
- The tool is available by `brew install kamilsk/tap/godownloader`.
- The installation is also possible by
  `curl -sSfL https://install.octolab.org/kamilsk/godownloader | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin`.
